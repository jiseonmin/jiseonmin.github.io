Hello, world! I am Jiseon Min. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Kern-Ralph lab](http://kr-colab.github.io) at University of Oregon. I am interested in mathematical biology, (using machine learning for) theoretical population genetics, and spatial population genetics. Check out the [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) for my publications and preprints.
